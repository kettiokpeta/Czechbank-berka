# Czechbank_challenge-berka_dataset

A Czech bank wants to improve its services. For instance, the bank managers have only a vague idea, 
who is a good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is a bad client (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank losses).
Fortunately, the bank stores data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted,
the credit cards issued, The bank managers hope to improve their understanding of customers and seek specific actions to improve services.
A mere application of a discovery tool will not be convincing for them.

The challenge here is to use advanced data science tools and techniques to mine,
and analyze this bank's data in order to understand the most suitable customers to be offered a credit card product.
An unsupervised learning technique might be ideal for this task.

Perform a detailed business requirement and data understanding

Ingest the datasets in the data_berka.zip folder (Tip - files in .asc format can be opened using a notepad or .txt) into a SQL Database. 

Create a relationship using the entity-relationship diagram and data dictionary attached.

Link Python to the SQL Database and consolidate the datasets to create a robust table for modeling using your knowledge of the data
and relationships

Follow the data mining steps including data exploration, feature selection and
choose the most appropriate and impactful modeling technique to use to deliver the requirement
